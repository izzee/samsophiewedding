      <h2>Weather!</h2>
      <p>The Gualala area stays relatively cool year-round (even in the summer)! Think foggy mornings with high 60s/low 70s
        during the day and chillier at night. Bring warm layers!</p>
      
      <h2>What to do!</h2>
      <p>This part of the Northern California Coast is beautiful and there's lots to do in nature. Bring comfortable walking
        shoes to go on hikes in the forest and walk along the bluff trails, and a bathing suit in case you want to brave the
        ocean or the Gualala river! There's also kayaking, tidepooling, and seal viewing !! Find some hot spots on this Map
        (as well as some recommendations for places to stop on the drive up).</p>
      <p>FYI as you will learn quickly, Stewarts Point–the town where the wedding venue is–is very small. There is a bakery, a
        post office, and the wedding venue! Gualala is the closest <em>town</em> town–it has a gas station, some restaurants,
        and two grocery stores. The Sea Ranch Lodge also has a coffee shop and a fancy bar and restaurant. And Point Arena to
        the North is also a cute little town with a lighthouse!</p>
      
      <h2>Where to stay!</h2>
      <p>There is camping, a handful of hotels, and rental homes in the area. We've put some of it together on this Map for
        you. We'll be staying at the St. Ores Inn :) If you have any questions, just give one of us a call or email.</p>
      
      <h2>Driving!</h2>
      <p>Gualala is remote. You will need a car or to group up with someone who has one to get around (we can help with this
        if you are looking for a ride from San Francisco/Oakland). <em>There will be transportation provided on the Wedding
          Day</em> from your various locations to Richardson Ranch and back again at the end of the evening. There is also
        parking available at the Ranch for those who prefer to drive.</p>
      <p>Also, cell service is intermittent as you get up the 1 so we recommend downloading your directions before you hit the
        road! And for those who have never been this far north in California, the 1 is quite windy, as are the mountain
        cut-throughs to get from inland Sonoma County to the Coast. We recommend you stock up on some dramamine for the ride
        if you tend to get queasy on windy roads.</p>

      <h2>Dress Code!</h2>
      <p>We're thinking cocktail attire or something fun! Whatever that means to you.</p>
      
      <h2>Gifts!</h2>
      <p>Gift or no gift we just want you to be celebrating with us. We would treasure any bit of art made with us or the
        moment in mind. We are also planning on going on a Honeymoon joyride to Brazil after the wedding. If you would like to
        give any money towards that trip we are accepting and appreciating it here. We also would appreciate donations towards
        the Palestine Children's Relief Fund here or No More Deaths here as gifts as well.</p>
